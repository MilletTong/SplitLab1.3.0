This file is to document, briefly, the changes between the Wustefeld distributed SplitLab1.0.5 to the current version
--Rob Porritt, Oct 2014

Version 1.2.0
- Updated a few parts to fit R2014b
- configpanelUSER had a line where a handle’s user data was set, but was causing a fatal error
- in SL_showeqstats.m changed the delete function in line 249 to remove the parameter ‘bins’
- edit splitdiagnosticLayout.m to put the diagnostic axes as children of the panels.
- Accelerators are not working properly in splitdiagnosticLayout.m in matlab R2014b. The uimenu must be active for the accelerator key to take effect.

Version 1.1.0
- Removed last dependence on mapping toolbox from the results box
- Saclab functions now all prefixed with "sl_"
- NEIC catalogue option removed; does not seem to work anymore
- CMT catalogue parsing updated slightly
- FetchEvent catalogue format added
- irisFetch.Event method of creating a new catalogue added
- Newly created or updated catalogues now because the default in the config
- mseed2sac file format reader fixed
-   Parameters are set in the panel and then an irisFetch.Traces call is made to pull waveform data directly to disk.
-   The retrieved waveforms should be automatically associated with the project, but the FINDFILES panel will also still work.
-   USER panel still available for those who wish to use email requests
- The full results, including the misfit matrices are now stored to stationName.mat in the savedir
- Station dialog allows users to fetch the station coordinates.
- Fetch traces contains a popup box to allow inclusion of username and password for restricted data
- Install gui properly checks for and install irisFetch.m and matTaup, unless user lacks admin control

Version 1.0.6
- handful of functions, such as azimuth, renamed with "sl_" appended to clear namespace
- reliance on mapping toolbox removed
-   rough plots replace most mapping toolbox calls
- findfiles format of mseed2sac added
- included a custom catalogue option, but format is not terribly useful.
- Created accelerator keys for user to put quality flag and null option quickly in results viewer
